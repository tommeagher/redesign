##Before we can fix the news, we need to redesign the newsroom

*Rough notes for the workshop on 3 p.m. Thursday, July 24 [at SRCCON](http://schedule.srccon.org/#_session-11)*

Let's get a bunch of smart people in a room and work together to produce a set of action-oriented recommendations for news organizations to truly adopt and integrate developers into their newsrooms as journalists.

In this session, I’d like us to talk about how we can redesign the newsroom itself to upend our clunky workflows pegged to Sunday’s newspaper instead of today’s news online. 

Until this spring, I worked for a major U.S. newspaper chain that had 75 papers in 17 states and zero developers in newsrooms working on editorial projects. At my paper before that, we had zero developers in our newsroom and no one in the company overtly doing news development. The status quo in both of those companies was that my team had to engage in a kind of guerilla warfare with the IT departments and the product and CMS developers to do the kind of journalism we know is important and even just to get our jobs done. Building and maintaining the CMS is critical and product development is important, but in my mind, every newsroom needs to have people who can crunch data and build interactive graphics and newsapps. How do we make that happen, when the vast majority of American newsrooms are like those in my former companies?

In May, I went to a workshop hosted by ASNE called "Hacking News Leadership," which brought together top editors from major metro dailies with data journalists and news developers. We spent a couple of days talking about some of these issues (the [recommendations are worth a quick read](http://bit.ly/1A7p0r8)). It was an important first step for many of the editors there to start hearing about this journalism. But there was one thing that [Trei Brundrett](https://twitter.com/ultracasual/status/462658533524123649) said that got me thinking:

> The most interesting design challenge of 2014 is of our organizations and how they work.

Too many news organizations, large and small, still either don't have news developers, or if they do, they're strapped on to the side of a workflow that revolves around making a great Sunday newspaper. It's 2014, we can do better. This exercise is about more than just rearranging deck chairs. Together, we can wipe the slate clean and design a newsroom that builds skills throughout the organization and forces people to think smarter about the internet as a primary medium rather than an afterthought.

###Today's session should break down roughly like this:
*25 mins - intro/venting/clearing the air*

Recruit a note taker for the scene setting

Go round the room and quickly have everyone introduce themselves. 

- Where are you from/what kind of newsroom do you work in?
- What's driving you crazy in your newsroom? What do you like?
- What do you want to get out of this? What would be useful for you on Monday?

*90 mins (1:55 hr) - group work*

We want to mix these groups up as much as we can. Try to be in a group with people you don't know. Let's get a mix of developer and non, green and experienced, newspaper and online, print and broadcast, whatever. 

Our goal today is somewhat broadly defined, and I want each group to be able to decide what you're going to produce, but here are some rough guidelines. We're not looking for another Google doc of bullet points. This can be code. This can be user stories. This can be prototypes. This can be an interpretive dance cycle. Whatever you think will have legs beyond this room. If you want to use a very strict, d-school, HCD process, go for it. **We're looking for both strategy and tactics here.** 

I want you to answer this question:

>How might we help integrate journalist-developers into our newsrooms and build more folks with those skills to produce high quality journalism online?

Your group will be assigned one of these scenarios to frame your thinking:
- A general interest, mid-sized metropolitan newspaper company with online operations of some sort. 
- A small newspaper with limited web presence and no history of news development
- A for-profit online-only startup newsroom covering a single subject or area.
- A breaking news centered operation
- A non-profit, investigative news operation.

At least one person in your group should be a notetaker. Each group should decide early on who will present their conclusions, either one person or the group as a whole.

If you haven't yet, look at the recommendations that came out of the [Hacking News Leadership](http://bit.ly/1kVq3ke) conference.

Some questions you'll want to consider:
* If you were the editor of your average major metro daily, how would you redraw your organization to make this work?
* How can we redesign our newsrooms to bring news developers into the reporting process at the beginning and to help everyone else master new skills? 
* Should we adopt [Ben Welsh’s philosophy](https://docs.google.com/a/tommeagher.com/presentation/d/1QdiQvVzUf1N7BkDZyo-XFgIQ8xqYWUR0de-BGaCijVQ/edit#slide=id.g17886bedb_010) that we ought to train web producers to become news devs and not just SEO-experts and explainer explainers? 
* Should we follow Scott Klein’s model of making every developer a reporter, designer and data expert?
* How many AMEs do you really need? 
* Should web producers sit together or with the copy desk and paginators? Should they be in the same room/floor/building/state as reporters and editors? 
* What are the jobs that really need to be done here?
* What's the budget impact of our changes?
* How does it work day to day?
* What product are the developers working on?
* Organization, distribution of responsibilities, hiring and skill development...


Keep in mind:
- We're talking about using code to build stories, experiences and tools, not getting more people comfortable with using existing tools, like cell phones, Twitter, etc.
- Newsroom managers tend to think of every staffing decision as a zero-sum game. "If we need a body to cover the courts, who will lay out the Family Circus page? WE HAVE TO HAVE A FAMILY CIRCUS PAGE OR THERE WILL BE RIOTING IN THE STREETS!" As much as you can, be prepared for these kind of counter arguments.
- Assume the worst. No newsroom is going to magically find $500,000 in their budget to hire a team of 5. What is a realistic path here?
- This is not nearly enough time to do this exercise, but it's better to start than to do nothing at all.


*10 min (2:05) break*

*25 mins (2:30) - presentations. Say 5 minutes per group.*
